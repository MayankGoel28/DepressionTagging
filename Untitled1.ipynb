      "I don\\'t know where to start this but I need to vent as well as ask for advice. My social life is pretty good but very spaced in meaning I have a lot of friends but I don\\'t have a group of friends just loads of mini groups or singular friends that I hang out with a lot however I just can\\'t ever feel fulfilled no matter how hard I try to socialize and be productive. I just feel like I\\'m having a mid-life crisis but at a young age? I have to think about my career path, what I\\'m going to do, finding more friends with my interests, going to a new school, worrying about loosing people, and just a lot on my plate. I have a lot of my own friends as well as people I don\\'t like going to my new school next year and those people have caused me a lot of mental health issues which I worry that they will approach me however I am going to do my best to avoid them but I still have doubts. I just get so tired in social situations easily and get depressed which I fear may have a huge toll next year and I don\\'t know what to do. There\\'s just so much going to happen and I don\\'t know how it will play out. The best I can hope for is a friend group who just aren\\'t \"too\" much and just are more chill and fun like the ones I have now.\n",

      "Hey,  I need a question answered.  Can I request some type of psychological report from my psychologist to give to me, my lawyer or my GP?  I’m Australian and was injured in a workplace accident exactly one year today in Canada whilst on a working visa.     My previous psychologist, told me she would document everything I’m going through in regards to the trauma I sustained. She told me I was exhibiting PTSD.  I didn’t find her very helpful though.. and decided it would be best not to see her anymore.  I emailed her asking for her to contact my lawyers to send them a report like she said she would.  She called me to say that she could not write any reports as there is a “jurisdictional issue” however she knew all this time it happened overseas.    She fed me some rubbish that she would contact her lawyers and find out if she could but she was pretty sure she can’t and would contact me back.  Also told me the psychologist company she worked for did not want to be associated with this?  Surprise surprise, she never contacted me back, she won’t open or respond to any of my emails.     I feel she has just made things worse for me. She is jeopardising my claim  too.  My lawyers in Canada are asking for this report. I don’t know what to say to them.   What do I say my psychologist refuses to provide you with the report.  I am doing CPT for PTSD with another psychologist, so I will be asking them if they can send something to my lawyers.     I just really need the first psychologist I was seeing to send this report Tommy layers.  Any information would be helpful? \n",

      "I'm really struggling at work and feel trapped in a job that no longer offers me the stimulation and accomplishments I need for my mental health and career progression. \"   \"I have a lot of family challenges and don't get much emotional support from home. I fell apart a bit earlier in the year as I couldn't sleep properly and even had a sleep study test done.\"   \"I've been too long in my role and \", \"I have been searching for another job. I used to love it but my team leader (not line-manager) is a very rigid micro-manager and I am unable to thrive under that kind of leadership. We don't communicate well and since I've been reporting to someone else she doesn't talk to me directly unless she has to. I can't win her trust.\"  I set myself very clear goals of what to accomplish this year to help me get another job where I can flourish. Unfortunately my role changed and throughout the year all my goals were unable to be met.    \"As it wouldn't be clear for a while what my new responsibilities would be, I reduced my hours for several months  and concentrated on networking and job applications. I felt great when I have an 'iron in the fire' but I haven't even had an interview and I am no longer in a good head space to look for work. After too many years in the same role my skill set doesn't suit what the market wants. I have therefore looked into PG Study as my workplace has a policy supporting this. This new focus is empowering and gives me hope. However, my line-manager has just urged me to consider delaying study because she's concerned that with my mental health issues it would be another layer that I couldn't cope with and they need me to be at full capacity next year.\"   \"I'm gutted because she has been very supportive of me finding ways to get some breadth. Her attitude seemed to change after she spoke with our line manager.\"   \"I am often sad at work. My morale is low. I'm sometimes very flat and avoid people and sometimes I've expressed frustration. I put effort into my work relationships but I've just been told I need to be careful how I present myself. I'm ashamed that I have made colleagues uncomfortable by crying at work. \"   \"I don't know what to do. I am trying to do all the right things. I have good peer support, I see a psych, I take meds, I exercise, drink less, keep good social contact, work on my marriage, support my special needs kids and make time for myself and my hobbies. I am mostly happy away from work except for some issues with communicating with my husband.\"         \n",
